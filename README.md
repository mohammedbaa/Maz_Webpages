# Maz_Webpages
Many people suffer while trying to find a house to buy or rent, or even while trying to sell/rent their houses. MAZ team is willing to end customers and owners suffering by offering their services. MAZ website is a website for house selling and renting. Offering a lot of new features, targeting customer satisfaction. 

# Project Overview
All citizens need houses to live in. It’s one of each individual life basics. Therefore, we or our close ones as citizens have always suffered from such problems. So, we came up with this idea where all Jordanian’s even stake holders can participate in. MAZ website will offer customers a place to look for houses for sale or rental. To try to make it easier and accessible for everyone. For example, employees don’t have the time to go look for houses on field. This is where our website comes in handy in such case.
Home ownership means the buyer has purchased a housing unit as property. Home ownership in our website made possible through cash payment. Furthermore, house owners will be able to contact admins to reach an agreement to list their houses for rental or sale. When an agreement is reached the admin validates it and posts an advertisement. On the other hand, customers can view our website and utilize all features freely.
